# heatmaps
In this project, I am investigating the digital presence of Yara's products within each country across 2021 to 2022. Furthermore, due to the large amount of data I am dealing with, I wanted to minimize the amount of manual work if possible. 

Therefore, I created a Python code which reduces the number of steps as much as possible to create a heatmap, or choropleth

Some libraries that I used include: pandas, geopandas, shapely, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib

All of my country shapefiles were obtained from https://data.humdata.org/
