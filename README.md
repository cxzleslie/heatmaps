# heatmaps
This project dives into the digital presence of Yara's products within each country across 2021 & 2022. The aim of this project is to automate the creation of heatmaps/choropleths as much as possible, reducing manual data entry work.

Libraries & packages used include: pandas, geopandas, shapely, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib

All of my country shapefiles were obtained from https://data.humdata.org/
